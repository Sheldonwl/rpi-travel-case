# rpi-travel-case

This repository contains all info needed to recreate my Raspberry Pi Travel Case. This travel case was created to demo K3s and consists of 6 Raspberry Pi 4B's, a 7" Touchscreen, 500GB SSD and Pimodori Blinkt RGB LED's. The setup consists of a Server and 5 clients. With PXE boot the clients netboot of the server.
